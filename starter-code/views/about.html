        <p class="centeredDiv size">My name is Jaime. I was born in a northern Mexican city called Monterrey. When I was 2 years old, my family and I moved to another Mexican city called Cuernavaca. We lived there 5 years, and then we moved to Mexico City, where we stayed 5 years. At the time I was 12 years old, we moved to Madrid, Spain, where I lived the passed 12 years. Four weeks ago I moved to Miami to start this amazing legit Web Development Bootcamp!</p>

        <p class="centeredDiv size">I have two brothers and one sister. My older brother, Pablo, lives in Barcelona and works at HHRR. My other brother, Diego, lives in Madrid. He just finished his Medicine Degree and he is doing an internship. My sister, Marina, is studying Maths in NY.</p>

        <p class="centeredDiv size">I love sports. When I was younger, I used to enjoy soccer a lot, but with time, I discovered that this sport is full of savages. So now, my favourite sport is footbal, which I have been practicing for the past 3 years. I also love skateboarding but I'm not good at it. If e-sports are considered sports,then I would say that my favourite one is League of Legends. I have a team back there in Madrid where we played some tournaments but lost all of them. I've been playing for many months and I am not that good player. But I enjoy it.</p>
